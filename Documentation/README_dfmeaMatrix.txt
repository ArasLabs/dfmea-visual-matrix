This addon adds a colored matrix to the DFMEA form, allowing visual representation of the severity/occurence/detectability of a DFMEA:
- X axis represents severity
- Y axis represents occurence
- The cells contain the detectability, further reflected by the font size
- Clicking on the table toggles between before and after action

Use the Aras Import tool in "Merge" mode to add the feature to an Aras Innovator instance with the QP solution.
Tested on Aras Innovator 9.2.0, 9.2.0SP1, and 9.2.0SP2, in IE7 and IE8.

Feel free to contact us for any question of customization request.
